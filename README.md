# KAS Project
KAS (kbz_8 allocator system) Project is a mini project made for fun. It's my own implementation of malloc(), free(), realloc(), calloc(), ... C functions for Unix systems. It is rather light. There are a compiled version (with a .c file) and a header only version (easy to implement in your projects (include "kas.h") but it is slower).
