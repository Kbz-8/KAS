# KMlib Project
KMlib (kbz_8 memory library) Project is a mini project made for fun. It is a memory lib that contains allocator, garbage collector and memory manager. It is rather light. There are a compiled version (with a .c file) and a header only version (easy to implement in your projects (include "kmlib.h") but it is slower).
